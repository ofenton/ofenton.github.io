excerpt: Some interesting tech blogs worth reading

---

 * Insights from [ThoughtWorks][tw].

 * Martin Fowler's personal [blog][mf].

 * Engineering blogs from two Silicon valley companies that are doing engineering properly, [LinkedIn][li] and [Netflix][nf] . LinkedIn particularly has interesting posts on scalability issues.

 * Tech blogs from [Twitter][twit] and [Atlassian][at] aren't bad either.

With thanks to [Syamantak][sm] for suggesting these.
